VBA code parses stock data divided by quarters by creating two summary tables for each quarter. The first table created for each quarter shows each ticker, their quarterly change, percentage change and total stock volume. The second table summarises the data into the ticker with the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease and greatest total volume.
